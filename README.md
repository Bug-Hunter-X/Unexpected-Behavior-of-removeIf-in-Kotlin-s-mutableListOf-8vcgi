This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior of the `removeIf` function when used with Kotlin's `mutableListOf`. The `removeIf` function is designed to remove elements from a list based on a predicate. However, when the list is modified during the iteration, the behavior can be counterintuitive. The bug.kt file contains code that showcases this behavior. The BugSolution.kt file provides a solution.
